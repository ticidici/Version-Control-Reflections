+ When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
- When working with more people or different machines.
+ Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
- Maybe you are working on your local version at the same time, or just working on a particular branch.
+ Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
- Fork copies a github repository into your github account. Clone copies a repository from github to local. Branch creates a new label in the repository, that may point to a different commit than your previous labels.
- I would use fork to experiment with someone else's repository if I don't have access to it, and maybe propose changes later.
- I'd use clone for getting a repository on my local machine, in case I started the project there, or me or some collaborator started it from another machine and pushed it to github.
- I would branch to add experimental features to a project without messing the production branch.
